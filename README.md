######################Euclidean Distance############################

In mathematics, the Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the "ordinary" (i.e. straight-line) distance between two points in Euclidean space. With this distance, Euclidean space becomes a metric space. The associated norm is called the Euclidean norm. Older literature refers to the metric as Pythagorean metric.


This program is written in Java MapReduce Hadoop. The input file consist of 3 parameters sepeated by ',' 
1 - id
2 - x1
3 - x2

if there are 2 same ids then ( (x1-x2)^2 + (x1-x2)^2 )^ (1/2) will be performed and if there are 3 same ids then ( (x1-x2)^2 + (x1-x2)^2 + (x1-x2)^2 )^ (1/2) will be performed and so on adn so forth....
